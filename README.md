# Music Module

**⚠️ Deprecation Notice**

This music module will be deprecated until further notice. Due to performance limitations on the current VPS setup, the module cannot reliably handle the processing demands of **ffmpeg** for real-time music streaming and effects. As a result, users may experience intermittent lag, buffering issues, and inconsistent audio quality, which we aim to resolve in a future environment upgrade.

## Reason for Deprecation

The current VPS has limited CPU and memory resources, which are insufficient for **ffmpeg** to manage high-quality audio processing and streaming at a consistent performance level. This is especially true for high-bitrate and multi-filter audio streams, which require robust system resources to avoid lag and maintain a smooth experience.

## Future Plans

This module will be re-enabled and actively supported once a new VPS with higher specifications is acquired. The upgraded environment will allow us to:
- Optimize **ffmpeg** performance for smoother streaming
- Handle higher bitrates and multiple audio effects without lag
- Provide a stable, high-quality listening experience for all users

We appreciate your patience and understanding while we work to upgrade our system infrastructure. Stay tuned for updates on this module's availability!

## Alternatives

For now, users may consider:
- Using external music bots that support high-performance audio streaming.
- Testing the module locally if their personal system has sufficient resources to support **ffmpeg** processing.

Thank you for your support and understanding.
